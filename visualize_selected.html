This will be crucial for determining the quantum number.\nStep 2: Express the relationship between the box length L, the de Broglie wavelength \u03bb, and the quantum number n. In a one-dimensional box, this relationship is given by L = n\u03bb/2, where n is the quantum number we're trying to find.\nStep 3: Calculate the momentum p of the object using the given mass and speed. We know that p = mv, where m = 1.0 g = 0.001 kg and v = 1.0 cm/s = 0.01 m/s.\nStep 4: Calculate the momentum p using the values we determined in Step 3. p = mv = (0.001 kg)(0.01 m/s) = 1 \u00d7 10^-5 kg\u00b7m/s.\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation L = n\u03bb/2 to solve for n. We can express this as n = 2L/\u03bb. Then, substitute the known values for L (box length) and the calculated value for \u03bb (de Broglie wavelength) to find n.\nStep 6: Substitute the values for L (box length, 1.0 cm = 0.01 m) and the calculated \u03bb into the equation n = 2L/\u03bb. This gives us n = 2(0.01 m) / (6.626 \u00d7 10^-29 m) = 3.017 \u00d7 10^26.\n",
